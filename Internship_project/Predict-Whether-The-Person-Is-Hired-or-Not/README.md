# Predict Whether The Person Is Hired or Not
 As part of my data science coursework, I undertook a project to predict job hiring outcomes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This project aimed to analyze a dataset of job applicants' characteristics and determine whether they were hired or not based on their attributes.  Key Contributions:  Conducted data preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Performed exploratory data analysis: Investigated the relationships between different features and their impact on hiring outcomes. Applied the KNN algorithm: Implemented the KNN algorithm using Python and the scikit-learn library to classify job applicants as hired or not based on their attributes. Optimized model performance: Tuned the hyperparameters of the KNN algorithm to achieve the best classification accuracy and minimize misclassifications. Evaluated model performance: Employed various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the effectiveness of the KNN model. Visualized results: Presented the project findings through informative visualizations, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. Outcome:  Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm in predicting job hiring outcomes. Identified the key attributes that influenced hiring decisions, providing insights into the factors most relevant to employers. This project highlighted my proficiency in data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and data visualization. It also showcased my ability to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems, such as predicting job hiring outcomes using KNN
